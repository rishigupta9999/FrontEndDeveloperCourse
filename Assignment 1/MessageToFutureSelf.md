### Message to future self

I am not too concerned about one month in the future, since I already have 10+ years of web development experience. :)

One month in the future, I expect that the journey will be similar to some of the other languages I have learned.  These include:

* C
* C++
* Pascal
* Microsoft QuickBasic
* Objective-C
* C#
* Ruby

I don't expect that HTML, CSS and JavaScript will be much different.  But I would encourage my future self to consider the same lessons:

* Utilize StackOverflow
* Use the Chrome debugging tools to play with the various permutations of CSS parameters
* Use gratuitous logging and breakpoints in JavaScript
* Learn one feature at a time, don't worry about some of the more complex syntaxes
* Seek out other articles on language constructs that are confusing, depending on how confusing the lesson is.  Not sure how fast paced the course is.

### Dev Goals

The reason I'm taking this course, is that my skill-set as a developer is obsolete.  Most of my background has been C++ development, and realtime rendering / OpenGL.  Of course there is still demand for this, but the number of positions, and pay, is not as good as web developers.  A position with say 5 years of experience at AMD is not going to pay as well as a position of similar seniority at say LinkedIn, or Uber, or whatever.

My current role is as a PM for a web development team (Xbox Live at Microsoft).  But I may decide to move back into the engineering side in the future if I leave Microsoft (likely in the next year).  I know enough about web development to talk about it, prioritize and make high level architectural decisions.  But not enough to write code myself.

Web development is the present, and future - cloud applications and computing is here to stay.  And I'd rather have some more promise in my future career - whether it's with a web development startup, a larger company working on a cloud app, or my own startup.
